# Ops-docs

**Documentation Hub for the Opspawn Core Foundation**

This directory contains the central documentation for the Opspawn project, including `agentkit` and `ops-core`.

It follows the Di√°taxis framework, organizing content into:

-   `tutorials/`: Step-by-step guides for common tasks.
-   `how-to-guides/`: Practical recipes for specific goals.
-   `explanations/`: Conceptual discussions of architecture, design decisions (including ADRs), and core components.
-   `reference/`: Detailed API specifications and technical descriptions.

The goal is to provide comprehensive, clear, and accessible documentation for developers and users of the Opspawn ecosystem.
